Most of my production-grade work is under NDA or hosted on private GitLab instances (corporate clients, internal tools, etc).  
But don't worry â€” public writeups, RAG demos, and side tools are in the works and will be dropped here soon.

Meanwhile, hereâ€™s the type of stuff I usually build:
- LLM-powered assistants with retrieval, filtering, and memory
- Agentic pipelines using LangGraph / ReAct-style orchestration
- SaaS-style AI tools for e-commerce, internal search, or compliance
- Custom vector search stacks (Qdrant/Chroma + metadata + rerankers)
